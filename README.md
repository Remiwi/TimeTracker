# TODOS

### Bug fixes

- [ ] Can't make template in last column of new row when first 4 rows are filled
- [ ] Text inputs are not centered
- [ ] App sometimes stops responding on the settings screen, mainly when opening sync settings from tutorial
- [ ] When a timer was running, I started a new one but it didn't get synced with Toggl. I then started another new one that did get synced. The First entry lasted until the start of the Third entry, as did the second.
- [ ] Days in the activity screen are decided by UTC... also the grouping of entries is lowkey ugly
- [ ] long entry description makes icon fly away!

### Features

- [ ] Not letting me just change the time to something invalid for a second is annoying.
- [ ] Make the sync thing happen when you pull down, and make it work in the main screen. Also add an indicator or something for whenever syncing is happening
